While both arrays and arraylists are used in Java to store multiple values, their functions and features differ. When you know the precise number of elements and you don't need to add or remove items frequently, arrays are more efficient and faster. An array is a fixed-size data structure that stores elements of the same type; once it is created, its size cannot be altered. A Java Collections Framework ArrayList, on the other hand, is a resizable array that can expand or contract dynamically at runtime. ArrayLists also have built-in methods like add(), remove(), and contains() that facilitate list manipulation
